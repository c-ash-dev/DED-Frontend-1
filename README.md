This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.

## Getting Started
Angular is an app-design framework and development platform for creating dynamic single-page apps.

### Node.js
Angular applications require Node.js and the npm package manager. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### npm package manager
Once Node.js is installed, run `npm install npm@latest -g` to install the latest version of npm.

## Angular CLI (Optional)
To install the Angular CLI, run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

### Installing npm package dependencies
When npm has finished downloading, navigate to this repo and run `npm install`. This will download all of the required npm packages listed in package.json.

## Development server

If you have installed the Angular CLI globally, as shown above, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Otherwise, prefix any commands related to the dev server with `npm run`. For example, to start the local server, run `npm run ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help
